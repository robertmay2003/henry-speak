Hello everybody. A lot of people on YouTube, you’re calling me a homo all because one user on YouTube called me one. That doesn’t give you the right to call me a homo. You’re only calling me a homo because that bluestrummer posted a video. And you know we’ve been spending – we’ve been sending each other private messages and we became friends and – and he called me a homo.

He copied and pasted one of my videos and he called me a homo. And – and you’re just on his side.

Why don’t you just leave me alone. If you’re going to call me a homo then…I don’t know what – I don’t know what to say.

If you are going to call me a homo then – then back off! A lot of you people are making edited versions of my videos and copying and pasting my videos and I will not have it! Got it!

Stop calling me a homo or you will be sorry. Imbeciles.
